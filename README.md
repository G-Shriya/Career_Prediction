# Career_Prediction


Taking decisions regarding career is one of the toughest jobs in a student’s life.
Choosing a good career according to the interests is crucial as it decides a student’s
future. The main aim of the project is to develop an application which uses machine
learning techniques to help a student decide a suitable career according to their interests.
The existing career prediction systems mostly consider the academic performance of the
student, which alone is not sufficient to decide a student’s interest. The proposed system
not only overcomes this limitation but also provides guidance to the students after the
prediction is made. This application helps reduce human intervention in human
dependable problems and scenarios.
The project involves taking inputs such as academic interests, non-academic
interests, personality traits, etc. in the form of a questionnaire and predicting the most
suitable career option for the user. Machine Learning classification algorithms such as
Decision Tree Classifier, Naïve Bayesian classifier, Support Vector Machine and KNN
(K-Nearest Neighbor) classifier, are used and their accuracies are compared. The
Decision Tree Classifier gave the best accuracy among all the implemented algorithms.
Apart from predicting a suitable career, the application also provides guidance to the
user, based on career prediction. Basic information about the career option along with
basic and advanced guidance material which consists of training videos is provided for
key skills identified for the profession. The application will be useful for students who
are trying to decide their careers and need some guidance. In the long run, this will
contribute to the country by providing better-skilled professionals and improving job
satisfaction
