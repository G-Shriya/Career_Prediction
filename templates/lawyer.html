How to become a Lawyer?
</h1>
<p>
A lawyer or attorney is a person who practices law, as an advocate, attorney at law, barrister, barrister-at-law, bar-at-law, canonist, canon lawyer, civil law notary, counsel, counselor, solicitor, legal executive, or public servant preparing, interpreting and applying the law, but not as a paralegal or charter executive secretary.[1] Working as a lawyer involves the practical application of abstract legal theories and knowledge to solve specific individualized problems, or to advance the interests of those who hire lawyers to perform legal services. The role of the lawyer varies greatly across different legal jurisdictions.
</p>
<h2>What qualities do lawyer have?
<ul>
<li>Analytical Skills</li>
<li>Judgment</li>
<li>Perseverance</li>
<li>Public Speaking Skills</li>
<li>Listening Skills</li>
<li>Enquiring Skills</li>
</ul>
<br>
<center><h2>A step-by-step guide</h2></center>
<ul><li>Make Your decision</li>
<p>To become a lawyer, students have to choose between two options, whether to do law after 12th or after graduation.
Following are the details of the options present for students:
Pursuing law after 12th:If one has a strong interest in becoming a lawyer, students can prepare themselves for any bachelor's degree under law after 12th.
For any Indian students,
They can apply for a bachelor's degree in law, i.e., LLB. These degrees are duly recognized under the Bar Council of India.
If they need to get into top law schools, prepare for the entrance exams.<br>
Pursuing law after graduation: If one is interested in pursuing a law career in a particular field, a student must hold a degree first.
Most law schools accept any bachelor's degree, but students may also need an undergraduate degree in a business field in case students wish to become business lawyers.
Also, most law schools in India prioritized CLAT/LSAT- India entrance scores.</p>
<br>
<li>Qualify Yourself</li>
<p>After choosing from the above option, know about the entrance exams available to become a lawyer and make themselves qualify for the exams. Students require a high GPA with good entrance exams to get into high-ranked law schools. If one intends to pursue law in India, then make sure to meet the cutoff marks released by the Bar Council of India. Besides, some top law colleges consider the Law School Admission Test (LSAT-India).
Below are the top law exams in India.
Common-Law Admission Test (CLAT) is the main written examination that allows the students to get admission in 21 National Law universities in India for law courses such as LLB and LLM.
Other than these popular entrance exams, the university conducted other autonomous entrance exams under its norms.</p>
<br>
<li>Apply for the Entrance Test</li>
<p>After choosing the entrance exam, students have to apply for the exam.
Following are the process to apply for Entrance Exams:
Register for the test:CLAT scores give great attraction to the law school application, making students' applications stand out among others.
Give enough time before giving the entrance exam. Register for the exam on the official website. If one wants to become a lawyer within a few years after graduation, then apply for the exam in September/October in the graduation year.
Give your best at the test:CLAT is a two-hour examination which is conducted once a year. The CLAT score card is valid for one year.
Reappear if you aren't satisfied:Don't be worried if one failed or is not satisfied with the scores. Age is just a number here because these exams don't have any upper age limit to pursue law in India.
Law schools need a score of 50% or above in CLAT. If one fails to meet that score, take the preparation time even harder and apply for the exam next year because they don't have any restrictions on attempts.</p>
<br>
<li> Apply for Law School Admission</li>
<p>After clearing the entrance exams, students can apply for the law school of their choice.
Following are the details of applying to a law school:

Don't forget to have important documents: After clearing for the entrance exam, apply for CAS as soon as possible.

Don't forget to buy Credential Assembly Service (CAS). Most law schools use CAS. Once you send the transcripts, recommendation letters, and scores, they create them to a file and send them to law schools.
The second important document is the recommendation letter. Usually, law schools prefer a recommendation letter from their undergraduate faculty. Otherwise, one can also get a recommendation letter from present or past employers.
Now, a very important thing is the short essay. It is a good opportunity to attract the committee by expressing your new ideas in the field of study. If they have given a word limit for the essay, stick to it.
Finally, the cover letter should be very impressive so that the committee will know how interested you are in becoming a lawyer.
<b>Choose a good college using your Entrance score: </b>When you are applying for law schools, you should check the following to get yourself in a better law school,
Check the UGC and BCI-approved law schools. If you don't get any approved law schools, try again to prepare well.
Use your CLAT/ LSAT- India or another entrance score accepted by the Indian law school and your percentage to find a better law school for your scores.
Check for a passage rate of employment before you select the law school.
<b>Apply for multiple colleges: </b>Students have no restrictions to apply for law schools. You can apply to any number of good colleges that fall under your score. It may increase your acceptance rate.</p>
<br>
<li>After Admission in Law School</li>
<p>After getting admission to law school, students must be careful about some aspects of the law school and studies.
Following are some tips for students after joining law school:
Be a full-timer:To become a powerful lawyer, one needs to work hard also. You need to show your entire commitment only to becoming a lawyer.
Make sure to choose a full-time program and concentrate on classes.
Being a full-timer will keep you focused on the goal to become a lawyer.
Create a network and join study groups:Law schools may be too much to handle. So to handle such situations, students can join a study group which is a great opportunity to meet people and prepare for exams. Take your exams seriously because the grades are very important for placements.
Clear BAR exam:Now, graduates can select a particular state to practise after their graduation.
Each state has its bar exam and is conducted by the State Bar Council. So to practice in a particular state, graduates need to clear that bar exam.
Also, they can apply for the All India bar council exam conducted by the Bar Council of India.
Register for the bar exam and collect the required materials and prepare for the exam.
After passing the bar exam, graduates need to complete the character and fitness review.</p>
<br>
<li>Search for Jobs</li>
<p>The main purpose of studying in a top institute is to get a job with a good package. To get the dream job, you have to put in a lot of effort.
Following are some of the tips to get the dream job:
Apply for on & off-campus interviews:Start searching for the job early by being a clerk in semester holidays. It may not pay you well, but then it gives you a great connection with lawyers. You may decide which law you are going to practice.
Don't forget to apply for your campus placements and off-campus internships in your final year. Have your resume and other graduation documents handy.
Search through student-alumni networks:Your college study groups and alumni networks are great sources here. So contact the alumni and search for jobs through them.
Do Volunteer works:Doing volunteer work may not be good money, but it will give you experience and great value. To become a good lawyer and get an apt answer to this question, start doing Volunteer work after graduation. Volunteer work helps you keep the skills updated, and graduates can add that to their resumes.
