How to become an Engineer?
</h1>
<p>
Engineering is the art of applying scientific and mathematical principles, experience, judgment, and common sense to make things that benefit people. Engineers design bridges and important medical equipment as well as processes for cleaning up toxic spills and systems for mass transit. Engineering is the process of producing a technical product or system to meet a specific need.
</p>
<h2>What qualities do successful engineers have?
<ul>
<li>Strong in mathematics and science</li>
<li>Highly analytical and detail-oriented</li>
<li>Imaginative and creative</li>
<li>Good communication skills</li>
<li>Enjoy working in teams</li>
<li>Enjoy building or improving the way things work</li>
</ul>
<h2>Different types of Engineers</h2>
<ul>
<li>
Civil engineer
</li><br>
<img src="static/download.jpeg" height="250px" width="350px"></img>
<p>
For those with an urge to build major infrastructure that will potentially exist for centuries, this could be your field. Civil engineering covers many types of structures, from bridges and roads to railways and airports, dams and tunnels.
It can also involve smaller, more intimate projects in city spaces, such as parks and playgrounds, underpasses and riverside/coastal promenades, and major urban systems for utilities such as water.</p><br>
<li>
Mechanical engineer</li><br>
<img src="static/d.jpeg" height="250px" width="350px"></img>
<p>
Any machine that requires construction has likely involved the expertise of a mechanical engineer. Moving parts, changing temperatures, foreign operating environments, weight and strength of materials, etc. – they’re all the responsibility of the mechanical engineer.
The modern field of robotics is a booming industry for mechanical engineers, so much so that it’s becoming a specialisation in itself. But mechanical engineers might just as well be required in an agricultural environment as in a high-tech lab.</p>
<br>
<li>
Electrical engineer
</li><br>
<img src="static/d4.jpeg" height="250px" width="350px"></img><p>
For obvious reasons, with the digital age, the role and importance of the electrical engineer is changing dramatically. The smaller and more complex electrical circuits become, the more vital is the role of the engineer who is able to ensure they operate as intended.
That’s not to say that electrical engineers don’t still work on major projects such as power plants, mining developments, large vehicles and power solutions for major towns and cities. But they’re also now in enormous demand in the IT and technology arenas.</p>
<br>
<li>
Chemical engineer
</li><br><img src="static/d3.jpeg" height="250px" width="350px"></img>
<p>The chemical engineer brings chemistry, mathematics, physics and microbiology into play to create new and exciting products for use around the house, in the medical field, by industry – in any arena that requires chemical products.
Examples of chemically engineered products include washing detergents, pharmaceuticals, plastics, processed foods, industrial chemicals, fuels, agricultural chemicals, fertilisers, insecticides, and many more.
</p><br>
<li>Aerospace engineer
</li><br>
<img src="static/d2.jpeg" height="250px" width="350px"></img>
<p>
A niche field of engineering, aerospace specialists are specifically concerned with the development of vehicles intended to fly – mainly aeroplanes, helicopters and spacecraft. The aerospace engineer might work on the newest passenger aircraft, a hi-tech and highly secretive fighter jet, or a rocket built to launch a satellite to a distant planet.
</p>
<br>
<li>Computer Science engineer
</li><br>
<img src="static/d1.jpg" height="250px" width="350px"></img>
<p>Computer Science & Engineering (CSE) is an academic program at many universities which comprises scientific and engineering aspects of computing. Courses usually include programming, algorithms and data structures, computer architecture, operating systems, computer networks, embedded systems, algorithms design, digital logic and processor design, computer graphics, software engineering, database systems, virtualization.CSE programs also include core subjects of theoretical computer science such as theory of computation, numerical methods, machine learning, programming theory and paradigms.
</p>
</ul>
<br>
<center><h2>A step-by-step guide</h2></center>
<ul><li>FINISH 12TH SCIENCE STREAM SCHOOLING</li>
<p>The first step is to successfully complete 12th Science stream schooling (with Mathematics or relevant subjects) from a recognized board. Diploma in Engineering qualification holders are also eligible to pursue Degree Engineering course (relevant branch).<br>
</p><br>
<li>SCORE VALID MARKS IN RELEVANT ENTRANCE EXAM</li>
<p>Just passing 12th standard is not enough to secure admission in reputed Engineering institutes. For that, one must also appear for and score valid marks in relevant entrance exams. JEE, State-wise CETs, Institute-wise CETs are examples of Engineering entrance tests.
</p><br>
<li>TAKE PART IN ADMISSION PROCESS</li>
<p>Admissions are given to deserving candidates on the basis of merit marks scored by them. IITs have their own admission process. State Engineering Institutes are usually governed by a Technical Education body. In any case, relevant authorities will organize admission process that consists of merit marks evaluation, initial seat allotment, counseling and interview.
Private institutes also have quotas like- NRI quota, Donation quota etc. If you are eligible to make use of such a quota, register for the same.
</p><br>
<li>SECURE ADMISSION</li>
 <br>
<li>COMPLETE COURSE</li>
<p>The course is 4 years long. Academic program is divided into 8 semesters, with each semester lasting for a period of 6 months. It consists of internal tests, external exams, vivas, project work and industrial training sessions.
</p> 
<p style="color:brown;text-align:left;padding:10px;">After course completion, you may take up a job or go for higher studies. Higher education courses include- M.E or M.Tech., M.Sc., MBA, PG Diploma programs etc.
