Now that you have understood where you stand and what your dominant trait is.. Lets now get into the actual course. Lets now begin by understanding what leadership skills are. The video below provides a brief introduction about leadership skills.
<br><br>Before that let me explain it to you in brief:
<br>"Leadership skills are skills you use when oraganising other people to reach a shared goal.<br>Leadership is not just just one skill but rather a combination of several different other skills working together.<br><br>Some examples of skills that make up a strong leader are:
<li>Patience</li>

<li>Timely Communication</li>
<li>Team buliding</li>
