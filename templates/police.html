How to become a Police?
</h1>
<p>
The police are a constituted body of persons empowered by a state, with the aim to enforce the law, to ensure the safety, health and possessions of citizens, and to prevent crime and civil disorder.[1][2] Their lawful powers include arrest and the use of force legitimized by the state via the monopoly on violence.
</p>
<h2>What qualities do police officers have?
<ul>
<li>Compassion & empathy</li>
<li>Integrity</li>
<li>Negotiation skills</li>
<li> Eagerness to learn</li>
<li> Mental agility</li>
<li>Communication skills</li>
</ul>
<br>
<center><h2>A step-by-step guide</h2></center>
<p>
If you have just cleared your 10th grade and are determined to become a Police Officer then you are on the right track. Unfortunately, becoming a police officer after completing only 10th grade is not possible. You need to complete at least 12th grade to be eligible for various posts in the police force. So, after passing your Class 10, take up any of the Science, Commerce and Arts streams and prepare for your goal. Participating in sports or NCC/ Scout and Guide would also be helpful for your career.   
</p><br>
<p>Top Police Officer's Recruitment Exams</p>
<ul><li>UPSC CAPF</li>
<li>SSC GD Constable Exam</li>
<li>State Police Constable Exams</li>
<li>SSC CPO Exam</li>
<li>UPSC CSE (for IPS)</li>
<li>SPSC Exams</li>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Successfully pass a background check</li>
<p>You can expect any law enforcement agency you’re applying for to conduct a number of checks into your background, including criminal history and even credit history. While this isn’t literally the first step to becoming a police officer, it is the first one you’ll need to consider before you get too invested in the process. If you have concerns about how your background might impact your candidacy, you may want to consult a police academy admissions representative about it.</p>
<br>
<li> Acquire a degree or academy training</li>
<p>Generally speaking, the training process for aspiring police officers follows two routes:
<li>Completing training by earning a two- or four-year degree in Criminal Justice or similar field from a Peace Officer Standings and Training (POST)-certified college or university, or</li>
<li>Completing training through a government-approved police academy or training program.</li>
Whichever path you take, your training will include classroom instruction in state and local laws, covering topics like constitutional law, civil rights and police ethics. Recruits also receive training and supervised experience in areas such as patrol, traffic control, firearm use, self-defense, first aid and emergency response.
</p><br>
<li>
Pass the licensing exam</li><p>
The next step to becoming a police officer is to earn a passing score on your state’s police licensing board exam. Your education and training will prepare you to take the Peace Officer Standards and Training (POST) exam.most POST exams cover topics like: practical application and techniques, civil and criminal law, community policing, victims’ rights and management and communication. By passing this capstone exam, you are licensed to become a police officer and enforce the law in your jurisdiction. You are now free to seek employment with a police department.</p>
<br>
<li>Undergo psychological evaluation</li>
<p>Prior to becoming a police officer, law enforcement agencies will likely evaluate recruits for psychological stability and mental fitness. These psych tests vary, but generally include lengthy written exams and possibly a one-on-one interview with a psychologist. You may also be subjected to a polygraph test to cross-reference the answers provided in your application packet.</p>
<br>
<li>Continuing education and career advancement</li>
<p>Once you have completed all of these steps to becoming a police officer, you will still have plenty to learn. Nothing beats on-the-job experience to show you all of the specialized areas police officers might want or need to learn more about. The best officers are never done learning.</p>
